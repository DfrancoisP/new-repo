/*A DateTime object in many programming languages describes a date and a time of day. 
It can express either an instant in time 
or a position on a calendar, depending on 
the context in which it is used and the specific implementation. 

This tag can be used for all date and time related issues. This program asks you for a date and 
prints out the day of the week it falls on in the current year.*/
